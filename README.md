# rsa-tools/motif_databases

Databases of transcription factor binding motifs installed in the software suite Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools (RSAT).

This repository contains a collection of cis-regulatory motif collection imported from different open databases, as well as supplementary data of individual articles.

All motif files have been homogenised into the same format (TRANSFAC), which facilitates their usage (e.g. comparison and clustering of motifs, using motifs from different databases).
