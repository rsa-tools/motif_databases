# rsa-tools/motif_databases

Collections of transcription factor binding motifs installed in the different servers of the [Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools](http://rsat.eu) (RSAT).

This repository contains collections of cis-regulatory motifs imported from different sources, as well as supplementary data of individual articles. Most collections have a LICENSE file describing the terms of use.

All motif files have been homogenised into the same format (TRANSFAC), which facilitates their usage (e.g. comparison and clustering of motifs, using motifs from different databases).
